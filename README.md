# Data Visualization and Analysis of Cryptocurrency

## Project Overview

This project is a Python application that scrapes and visualizes cryptocurrency data, focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, using the Kraken API. It includes data analysis features, such as calculating logarithmic returns, and provides a range of visualizations, including historical prices, logarithmic returns, a correlation matrix, and a mean returns bar chart.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Retrieves OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple from the Kraken API.
- **Data Cleaning**: Manages missing values to ensure data consistency.
- **Logarithmic Returns**: Computes and analyzes the logarithmic returns for each cryptocurrency.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Historical Prices
  - Logarithmic Returns
  - Correlation Matrix of Returns
  - Mean Returns Bar Chart
